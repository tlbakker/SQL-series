-- FINDING THE MASTERMIND

-- Step 1:
--SELECT * FROM interview
--WHERE person_id = 67318

--I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. 
--I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
--She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. 
--I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017

-- Step 2:
SELECT p.name, dl.id as dl_id, fb.*
FROM person as p
INNER JOIN drivers_license as dl
	ON p.license_id = dl.id
INNER JOIN facebook_event_checkin as fb
	on p.id = fb.person_id
WHERE dl.hair_color = 'red'
AND dl.gender = 'female'
AND dl.car_make = 'Tesla'
AND fb.date like '201712%'
AND dl.height BETWEEN 65 AND 67

-- Result:
